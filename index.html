<h2>Who am i</h2>
<p>Motivated and multidisciplinary individual with a strong foundation in science, education, and technology. I bring experience in mentoring, and software development, combined with a passion for teaching, communication and innovation. As a senior mentor at Videnskabsklubben, I developed and led engaging science programs for children and adults, fostering curiosity in biology, chemistry, and physics. My early experience as a software developer at Interxion (now Digital Realty), where I earned the Innovation Award in 2019, reflects my analytical mindset and creativity in solving real-world problems.

Currently pursuing a degree in biomedicine at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU), I am dedicated to gain scientific knowledge and combine with practical experiences. My academic performance highlights my commitment to excellence.
